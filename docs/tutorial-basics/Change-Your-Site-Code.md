# Downloading An FTP Client

The first step to changing the code of your recently created website is downloading an ftp client.

The PixelByte team would suggest **[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)**

After downloading **WinSCP** start a new session.
Make sure that the protocol is FTP, there is no encryption, the port is 21. 
Now enter the FTP details from the **[CPanel](https://cpanel.pixelbyte.dev/)**

Now head to the folder **htdocs**, and edit the index.html file.
